Make double array of buttons, the buttons on the board

Make array of peaces (for black & white seperate array) to check if something is on it when moving a chess peace -> loop thru the [turn color] and see if that color is already on it, else, you can go there.

Gameplay:
1. Make board of buttons -> 9x9 (only make the buttons clickable if something is on it)
2. When button pressed -> check if something is on it, and what (using the sprite name eg. white_Queen or black_King)
3. Make the possible moves green, and make the possible moves clickable
4. When clicked, go to the position (for now just teleport to it)
5. After each turn, check if king is possible to move, else win
6. After a turn, let the other person have a turn (print the color of the turn)
7. When won, print [color] won the game

GUI:
1. Make restart button to play again
2. Have a GUI Button that lets you start the game
3. Have a Home interface with: Play, Quit
4. Quit: Exit game
5. Play: Play game with a random turn to white/ black
6. When two of the peaces collide on same square (black & white), remove the peace that wanst its turn 

Methodes:
1. board[,] - getNewBoard(); -> returns fresh board
2. board[,] - getBoard(); -> returns board
3. String - whatIsOnIt(int x, int y); -> check what color and peace is on the pressed button
4. boolean - makeGreen(String peace, int x, int y, boolean makeGreen); -> checks what peace it is, and makes the board turn green where it may go using the getBoard() methode.
5. boolean isGameOver(); -> locates the king and checks if it is possible to move the king using makeGreen() methode, returns true/ false and using the makeGreen booelean, set it to make it green or not
